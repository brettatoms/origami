**Support for OpenCV4-beta is in.**

Origami is an opencv generated wrapper for Clojure which allows some of the opencv code to be written in a concise way, by putting emphasis on processing pipelines.

# NEWS! Book is out!!

[Java Image Processing Recipes: With OpenCV and JVM](http://a.co/3iImWz7) published by Apress will show you all the tricks to play and produce art and understand the underlying concepts of origami.

# Getting Started 

## Required Software to install

- install jdk 1.8
- install [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install) (it is a simple script ...)
- that's it ! (as in, no need to install anyother OpenCV thing ...)

## to use

Create a brand new origami based project using a Leiningen project template

```
# install the sample
lein new clj-opencv hello-origami

# change directory

cd hello-origami

# run the template simple example
lein run
# or ..
clj -m opencv4.ok
```
You can also clone the origami samples project:

```
git clone https://github.com/hellonico/origami_samples.git
```

# Running the samples


Some examples are included in the project template.

Origami Setup Check (including OpenCV native dependencies check)
```
lein run -m opencv4.ok
```

Some Simple OpenCV transformation using origami
```
lein run -m opencv4.simple
```

A more advanced set of imaging transformation.
```
lein run -m opencv4.tutorial
```

Webcam Sample
```
lein run -m opencv4.videosample
```

Gorilla Based Notebook

```
lein notebook
```

And two notebooks are included in the project template:

- [http://0.0.0.0:10000/worksheet.html?filename=notes/practice.clj](http://0.0.0.0:10000/worksheet.html?filename=notes/practice.clj)
- [http://0.0.0.0:10000/worksheet.html?filename=notes/empty.clj](http://0.0.0.0:10000/worksheet.html?filename=notes/empty.clj)

# more samples

For many, many more examples, you can also clone and check the [https://github.com/hellonico/opencv-fun](opencv-fun) repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hellonico/opencv-fun.git
```
